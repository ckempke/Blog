So the Bluehosts software finally drove me nuts; they still haven't fixed display in Safari (in their default theme!) after a couple of years, and it take minutes or more to actually load the editor to write each post.

This is just a github pages, using MkDocs, the Material theme, and a blogging plugin from https://liang2kl.codes/mkdocs-blogging-plugin/.   So I can edit it with the tools I already use every day.
