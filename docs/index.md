title: Christopher Kempke's Blog
---

Welcome to my little corner of the Internet!

I'll assume you're now of my legions of fans that have come from the Terrain Generation pages: [https://ckempke.github.io/UnityTerrainGeneration](https://ckempke.github.io/UnityTerrainGeneration) with questions like "wait, you have legions of fans?" and "how do I actually find what's new on that site, anyway?"     

You'll be ecstatic to learn that this is a much more traditional "Blog" format, with, like, dated pages and "most-recent-at-the-top" and all that cool stuff that was state of the art in the late 90's.

## About this Site

A few of you may have stumbled on my previous blog, with one of those hosting services that shall not be named.   I'm not entirely sure how they continue to exist, but this one takes forever (minutes sometimes) to process every change, doesn't support Safari (mobile or desktop) with their main theme, and seems more intent on upselling various services than actually providing a web site.   Ah, well, water under the bridge.

Very expensive water.

We're now hosting on GitHub pages, which is free (for sites within reason), pretty easy for a developer to use (it's the same git tools we use every day, and the content is just Markdown), and extremely performant.

This site uses the MkDocs publishing system, Material theme, and a blogging plugin from [https://liang2kl.codes/mkdocs-blogging-plugin/](https://liang2kl.codes/mkdocs-blogging-plugin/).   Material is supposed to support blogging internally later this year (2022) or early next, so the appearance of the site may change then.

I use KaTeX for mathematical markup, and Mermaid-js if I need graphs or flowcharts.

## Cookies

If this site uses cookies, I don't know about them.   It's possible the underlying document presentation engine does.   In any event, by continuing to use the site:  

- You agree to all cookies, even the ones with raisins in them and even if you don't like raisins.   
- You also agree to send me all your money
- You agree not to consult a lawyer about whether or not the previous clause is enforceable or not.

I don't want your personal information, and if I get any on me, I'll wash it off.   However, I think that usage statistics are gathered here by some analytics engine or other.  So if you're particularly paranoid about your IP address or something, be aware that someone's probably got it in a log somewhere.
