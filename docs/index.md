# Christopher Kempke's Blog

Welcome to my little corner of the Internet.

My legions of fans may have come from the Terrain Generation pages: https://ckempke.github.io/UnityTerrainGenerationÂ with questions like "wait, you have legions of fans?" and "how do I actually find what's new on that site, anyway?"     You'll be happy to know that this is a much more traditional "Blog" format, with like dated pages and most-recent-at-the-top and all that cool stuff that was state of the art in the late 90's.
