It is from a previous blog that predates the very existence of this one.] Being the Internet, I should probably attribute that to either Mark Twain or Abraham Lincoln (and in fact, Google and Bing give dozens of people who supposedly said it), but it's from Andrew Tannenbaum's Computer Networking textbook that I used when I was in college, and seems to be original with him. My \"standard of the day\" is Markdown. If you're not familiar with it, it's basically \"HTML lite\" -- a way of writing documentation by specifying the function, rather than the format, of each textual element, and then it gets magically massaged into something that looks good. It's very lightweight, very broadly supported, and you can learn it in about fifteen minutes (for example, look here: https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). It makes up the baseline documentation format for many blog tools (including this one, although I haven't figured out how to turn it on, yet), GitHub, most modern Wikis, and the internal documentation systems of both Android and Apple. Apple's recent WWDC had a number of sessions on their flavor, called DocC, that's basically the future of formatting for them (even for in-code comments, which is pretty slick, actually). As a baseline documentation language, it serves roughly the same function for technical writers as C does for developers: what you use might not be exactly the same, but you can bet it's heavily influenced by it. But--as with C-like languages--\"flavor\" is the right word. John Gruber invented it in 2004 or so, and the basics haven't changed much. But all it really does is give you formatting of lists in various ways, headings and outlines, paragraphs, internal and external links, and the sort of basic \"emphasis\" technologies like italics and boldface. Which is actually sort of a nice feature: it basically removes the emphasis from formatting back to content . But there's a lot of ways of presenting information, some of which are pretty standard: footnotes, references, tables, various types of \"code\" blocks, and the like. So lots of systems have \"extended\" it in various ways, and not all of those are compatible with each other. So when someone tells you to write in Markdown, \"Which one?\" is not an unreasonable question. Probably the de-facto winner in the Markdown war is \"Github Flavored Markdown,\" (https://github.github.com/gfm/) just because of its centrality to one of the most common developer tools on the web. So if that same someone responds to your question with \"Uh, I don't know?\" GFM is a good baseline assumption. Github also has a backend system called Github Pages that allows you to add structured Markdown files to your Github projects (or just to your Github account), and it will render them using its \"Jekyll\" rendering engine. Looking into technologies for a potential writing project, a former boss of mine pointed me at Docsify (https://docsify.js.org/#/), which is a replacement for Jekyll that does a little more stuff: in particular, it supports custom sidebars/guides, renders the markdown into HTML on demand (rather than requiring a compiling step), and is also supported by Github Pages. Even better, if you fuss with it a little bit, you can use Mermaid (https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) in code blocks, which gives you a near-magical ability to create the various charts (Gantt, Flow, Sequence Diagram, etc.) that make up the technical documenter's nightmares, using a language so simple you can teach it to pretty much anybody who understands what the charts are supposed to represent. I've been playing with this a bit on a GitHub project for terrain generation in the Unity game engine. You can see the documentation as it gets written here: https://ckempke.github.io/UnityTerrainGeneration/#/","title":"The nice thing about standards is that you have so many to choose from."},{"location":"blog/8-DEC-2021/","text":"[This blog post has time travelled. It is from a previous blog that predates the very existence of this one.] We often don't pay much attention to the humble apostrophe. It serves its purposes so well that it just sort of blends into the background, unnoticed and unloved. But it lies at the epicenter of an interesting and common cognitive bug. The apostrophe serves several purposes (in English, anyway). First, an apostrophe can indicate elided (left out) letters in contractions. When we lose the \"o\" in \"does not\", it is replaced with an apostrophe: \"doesn't.\" Similarly \"cannot\" becomes \"can't,\" and so on. The utility of this in modern English is debated; some styles prohibit contractions at all in formal writing. After all, \"doesn't\" replaces a mere two characters (the \"o\" and a space) with one (the apostrophe itself), and the savings in other contractions are similarly small. If the goal is saving space, abbreviations, acronyms, and other more powerful linguistic tools are a better choice. There are environments where saving a character or two matters a lot: the canonical example is print newspapers, whose narrow columns are prone to unfortunate line breaks. But for most writing, most of the time, the contraction is a stylistic choice. Where it really shines is conveying dialog; however much we may differ in expressing ourselves in writing, nearly everyone uses contractions in speech. It's difficult not to: the science fiction character Data from Star Trek supposedly cannot (or does not) use contractions, but the writers of the show accidentally included them with some frequency despite this. In writing, both fiction and nonfiction, contractions help convey how people actually speak. Apostrophes help with dialog in other ways: they can convey a sort of inside-a-word pause like glottal stops or syllabic breaks, either when transcribing a word of foreign origin like \"Sahai'a\" or \"Xi'an,\" or for ex-contractions where the original form has vanished from usage entirely, such as \"o'clock.\" Science fiction writers love this for \"alien\" names; there are books where every other character's name is something like \"K'th'q'dp'tl'nt'sr'thik.\" (For real-world speech which uses sounds atypical in other languages--such as that of the San people--all sorts of punctuation may be waylaid and repurposed for transcription.) Probably the most common use of the apostrophe, however, is to show possession. The \"girl's pet,\" the \"shop's inventory,\" the \"dog's bone.\" This use is so common that it's often misused , ala Dave Barry's joke that the use of an apostrophe is to indicate to the reader that an \"s\" is coming up. And the misuses are interesting to me. I'm a writer. Directly and otherwise, a significant portion of my income has always derived from my ability to convey information in written form; it's safe to say that I do this for a living. And yet, I cannot seem to get \"its\" and \"it's\" right in my first drafts--I'm so consistently wrong that checking it is the first item on my personal proofreading list. Heck, this article is literally about the use of \"it's\" and \"its\", and I've had to correct the mistake twice already. Luckily for my writing ego, I'm not alone. I consume a lot of writing as well as producing it, and a surprisingly large percentage of the writers use the wrong form frequently. A quick google indicates that it's a problem for a very large number--perhaps even a majority--of \"casual\" writers of English. (It is, ironically, one of those mistakes made much less frequently by non-native speakers.) It's not that I don't know the rule, and I suspect it's not that other writers don't know the rule, either. We teach this distinction in roughly third or fourth grade in the US. My suspicion is that what we're looking at here is a conflict in how our brains deal with rules in general. Grammar is hard. The rules of English grammar alone are enough to fill a very long book, and--largely because English has borrowed from so many other languages over time--the rules often have exceptions: > *\"I\" before \"E,\" * > > *Except after \"C,\"* > > *Or when sound is \"long a\",* > > *As in \"neighbor\" and \"weigh,\"* > > *None of which helps a bit,* > > *With \"weird\" \"foreign\" words, like \"counterfeit.\"* As an amusing(?) aside, a recent study found that the \"'I' before 'e'\" rule in English is actually *wrong* slightly more often than it's right. The exceptions don't just prove the rule, they outnumber it. If we had to pin down every rule, exception, and usage for everything we say or write, we'd never get to convey anything. So we rely on sentence patterns, experience, and rules of thumb to get us through. These \"rules of thumb\" are simpler rules that--hopefully--fail us rarely enough that it doesn't matter. We can keep enough of these simpler rules \"in our heads\" to help us through day to day conversations and writing, and either live with or deal with the exceptions in a separate pass or with separate tools. It's obvious that the particular rule set is at least somewhat personalized. Consider the sentence: > *\"Ameilia has less apples than Feifei.\"* From my casual surveys, about half the people who hear that cringe internally, and the other half don't give it a second thought. The difference--one I think interesting enough to have its own article--is whether or not your personal rule set includes \"use 'fewer' rather than 'less' for countable items.\" So, back to \"it's\" and \"its.\" We have a few rules that apply here: > **Rule 1:** Use an apostrophe followed by \"s\" after a singular noun or > pronoun to indicate possession. (And an \"s\" followed by an > apostrophe for plural ones.): \"Bob's hat,\" \"one's speech,\" \"the city > schools' funding,\" \"dogs' rights.\" > > **Rule 2:** Use an apostrophe for left-out characters in a > contraction: \"do not\" == \"don't,\" \"is not\" == \"isn't,\" \"it has\" == > \"it's.\" The problem is that there are exceptions. > **Rule 3:** We don't use apostrophe-s for pronouns, such as \"his\" for > \"he,\" \"their\" or \"theirs\" for \"they,\" or \"hers\" for \"her.\" > > **Rule 4:** Rule (1) doesn't apply If the plural form doesn't end in > \"s\", instead, we pretend it's singular: \"women's rights,\" not \"womens' > rights.\" > > **Rule 5:** Rule (3) doesn't apply if there's not a specific > possessive form of the pronoun: it's \"one's thoughts,\" not \"ones > thoughts.\" Worse, there is at least one case where the correct form depends on usage: > **Rule 6:** The form of \"they\" in the sentence \"That's their dog\" is > different from the one in the semantically identical sentence \"That > dog is theirs.\" \"Theirs\" is a possessive pronoun in this case, but > \"their\" is a pronoun-derived *possessive adjective*. Which is an > incredibly subtle distinction, but--weirdly--one that native speakers > almost never get wrong, even though probably fewer than one such > speaker in a hundred could tell you why. (And I'm not that one > person; I looked it up.) So, that's a lot of rules so far. But why do people have trouble with \"it's\" and \"its,\" but not the others, even in cases like rule (6) that are, on the face of it, much harder? I'd argue it's because your brain has brought too many rules into play. Most possessive pronouns or adjectives have a form different from their base pronoun form: \"His,\" not \"hes\"; \"my,\" not \"Is\"; \"their,\" not \"theys\"; and so on. Rule three only really matches two pronouns whose possessive and base forms differ only by the added \"s\": \"her/hers\" and \"it/its.\" Some quick googling indicates that there's actually a fair amount of folks out there that incorrectly use \"her's,\" but nowhere near the level of \"it's.\" I suspect that it's because \"her\" is a complex usage-based pronoun/adjective, similar to rule (6) above. > **Rule 7:** The feminine pronoun varies a lot based on usage: > > \"her\" as a pronoun, but only as the *object of the sentence*: \"I like > her.\" > > \"hers\" as a possessive pronoun: \"That book is hers.\" > > \"her\" as a possessive adjective: \"Amy ate her lunch.\" > > \"She\" as the pronoun if it's the subject of the sentence: \"She likes > me.\" In other words, if you use she/her/hers without further thinking about it, you're almost certain to get it wrong. So your brain has *prioritized* this rule as one to be applied *first* when you're using feminine pronouns. Perhaps more relevantly, you've probably internalized simple rule 8: > **Rule 8:** \"Her's\" is *never* correct in any usage. Because English doesn't make contractions from nouns uses as objects of sentences, there's no contraction form of \"her.\" \"She has\" or \"She is\" are both contractable--\"she's\" in both cases--but never \"her has\" or \"her is.\" At this point, you're probably sick of all these rules. And that's sort of the point; when your brain is trying to construct a sentence, it wants to get on with communicating, not go down checklists of grammatical minutia. And maybe more importantly, your brain evolved to listen, and to speak. Writing is comparatively modern, and even among those of us that do it professionally, we do a lot less of it than speaking and listening. In spoken English, there's no distinction between \"its\" and \"it's\" at all. So, when faced with the decision for a form of \"it,\" some of our brains pretty much give up after rules (1) and (2). In my experience, which rule gets applied tends to differ between people: I will incorrectly use \"it's\" when I mean \"its,\" but almost never the reverse, so my particular grey matter gives up after rule (1). I see others who primarily err the other direction. Why do non-native speakers have less trouble with this? Assuming that this statement is true (I have only anecdotal evidence to support it), my suspicion is because they're *always* bogged down in rules. Without a lifetime of internalizing patterns, you're basically forced to construct sentences by brute force, and so you're likely to spend more time with the internal checklists. It would be interesting to know whether or not this error starts to creep in as non-native speakers approach native fluency; I have no idea whether it does or not.","title":"If its \"it is\", its \"its\" is \"it's\""}]}
